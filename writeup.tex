Notes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prepared by creating abstract classes to represent evaluation functions so that they can be easily swapped out
    in order to test different ones and see which would perform better. All evaluation functions would return a score normalized
    from 0 to 100, which was important because this way we could easily return scores of 100 for victory and 0 for loss/cancellation.

    \item Began by implementing minimax with a very basic evaluation function that just used the difference in pits between my agent and
    the opponent. More pits = higher score for me. In testing it turns out that this function would only search to a maximum depth of 4 on 
    my machine; any higher depth would result in timeouts. It could beat the random agent around 90\% of the time, which was decent, but
    when searching to a depth of 4, only around 150ms would be used in computation. Clearly a lot of capacity was being wasted, so I decided
    to implement alpha-beta pruning in order to further deepen the search.
\end{itemize}
